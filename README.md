# exchequer
keep track of and analyse expenses

# TODO:
- add another plot with individual (not stacked) spending per category
- spending per day of the week
- spending in multiple currencies (only EUR and GBP supported for now)
- analyse in different currencies (only EUR and GBP supported for now)
- add income table
- add income to the expenses plot
- analyse spending per year rather than per month
